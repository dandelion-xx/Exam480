		<dt>What will happen to the XHTML 2 Working Group?</dt>
		<dd>When W3C announced the HTML and XHTML 2 Working Groups in March 2007, we indicated that we would continue to monitor the market for XHTML 2. W3C recognizes the importance of a clear signal to the community about the future of HTML.

		While we recognize the value of the XHTML 2 Working Group's contributions over the years, after discussion with the participants, W3C management has decided to allow the Working Group's charter to expire at the end of 2009 and not to renew it.</dd>

		<dt>What will happen to the HTML Working Group?</dt>
		<dd>The HTML Working Group will continue with its current charter. W3C management plans to increase staff resources dedicated to the Group, including dedicated Michael Smith's time entirely to it. We will continue to strive to make sure the group serves the interests of the W3C community.</dd>

	<h3>Is skydiving safe?</h3>
	<p>Skydiving is a high-speed aerial sport that exposes its participants to the real risk of injury and death. Each year in the U.S. about 35 people die while making approximately 2 million parachute jumps. Other skydivers are sometimes killed while riding aboard jump aircraft. Analysis of skydiving accidents show that most are caused by jumpers who make mistakes of procedure or judgment. Contrary to popular belief, very few skydiving accidents or injuries are caused by random or unexpected equipment failure.	Those skydivers who are trained well, who stay current and who take a conservative approach to the sport are involved in very few accidents and suffer few -- if any -- injuries. Some people prefer not to expose themselves to significant risks, while others accept the risk in exchange for the enjoyment the activity offers. Most parachute centers require that each customer sign a legally binding assumption-of-risk agreement. The document makes it clear that the sport has its risks and that the jumper is electing to jump in spite of those risks.</p>

	<h3>What are the age requirements?</h3>
	<p>As far as the government is concerned, there is no minimum age for skydiving in the U.S. But most parachute centers require their customers be at least the "age of legal majority" in their state -- typically 18 years of age.

There is no upper limit. There are many active skydivers who are in the 60s and older.</p>
